		 5. a) Primitive data types are pre-defined data types that are built in to the language. This includes int, float, char, String, etc.
		 	   An abstract data type is a concept or model of a data type. It's a class for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of values and operations.
		 	   
		 	b) A class is a template used for the creation of objects. The class has to declared first and only once. They define object properties.
		 	   An object is an instance of a class. Their properties are defined by values you explicitly define or are defined by default settings.
