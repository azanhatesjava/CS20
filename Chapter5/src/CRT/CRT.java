		 1. To execute statements repeatedly based on a condition
		 
		 2. A while loop tests the condition at the start of the loop and do while tests at the end of the loop
		    (While loop tests condition to let you in, do while tests condition to let you out)
		 
		 3. Prompter
		 
		 4. a) An infinite loop is a loop that keeps on repeating forever
		 	b) A syntax error (semicolon after condition statement) or a logic error (condition is never met)
		 	c) When a number cannot be stored due to the Java bit limit.
		 	
		 5. 60
		 
		 6. Loop will be finite no matter what
		 
		 7. A counter increases by a fixed amount. An accumulator increases by varying amounts.
		 	A counter can be good for seeing how many times a user enters input or how many times a loop repeats.
		 	An accumulator can be good for calculating grade averages or the sum of multiple numbers.
		  
		 8. for(int i = 3; i <= 10; i++)
		 		{
		 			tot += i;
		 		}
		 
		 9. You need to decide whether you want the loop to run at least once and how many times you want the loop to run.
